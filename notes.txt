    input job#
    input 2-letter initials...
    submit. (gets date & time)




Need to have a way to input job# and 2-letter initials.
After submit, save both as well as start time to CSV.

For the CSV logbook, want to setup the columns so that the order:
    Job# | Start D&T | End D&T | Setup type | Op. Initials 

Each step will have a checkbox acknowledgement and directional buttons to proceed to either the previous set or next step. 

Checkbox acknowledgement will contain the value or summary of the step taken.

At the last step, once acknowledged and finish setup button clicked, I want to generate a summary screen with all of the notes to be used in the monarch system. Also, once the finish setup button is clicked, save the ending setup date and time to the same CSV record. I think this will help my department immensely to alleviate any questions anyone might have about certain jobs.
