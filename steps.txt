The program will need to ask user what the produced piece is supposed to do:
    -Sheet (most postcards, will give option for perfing)
    -fold only (letters, roll fold or dbl parallel, add optional score)
    -fold, score/perf, glue (most self mailers)


General Flow:

1. Based off of the job ticket, select the flow that is best described (user must read job ticket and understand what they are producing.)

Sheeting (Postcards mainly.):
    1.Unwinder
    2.SVC
    3.Stacking Table 
    4.***Optional: T-perf***

Fold Only (Mostly letters, once this flow selected, will give optional score step mostly for the TFL brochure/Letter):
    1.Unwinder
    2.SVC 
    3.Folding unit
    4.Stacking Table
    5.***Optional: perf/score*** 

Self Mailers (Folds with glue):
    1.Unwinder
    2.SVC
    3.Folding unit (include segmenting the rollers, check fold to score/perf)
    4.Stacking Table
    5.Glue (heads, noses)

2. At the end of each step, include an acknowledgement checkbox.
3. Finishing the complete setup, for every checkbox clicked, does a printout of each step acknowledged for monarch notes. (check for checks lol)
